-- A cut tree goes on the frame it was cut.
--
-- A block edit makes the whole map's mesh stale, and refresh() keeps the old
-- mesh drawing while the rebuild runs, so the tree stayed up for about a
-- third of a second here and longer on a phone. The prop passes now record
-- where each thing they emit lands in the vertex stream, so those vertices
-- can be zeroed in the mesh already on screen.
--
-- Picking the right runs is the part worth pinning and it is pure, so it is
-- driven here. The zeroing itself needs a real mesh and was checked in game.
